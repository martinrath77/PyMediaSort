# PyMediaSort

PyMediaSort was develloped to sort pictures and videos into sub folders based on the year and month they were shot.

It has been used succesfully to sort over 35 000 pictures that are automatically uploaded from my phone into a single folder in my NAS. 

The only requirement is the ExifRead library.
